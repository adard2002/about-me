        Hello! I'm Lilly, I was born in Tacoma Washington and moved here to Cedar Rapids at the age of three. I graduated from Washington High School in 2010 and then attended Kirkwood Community College for several years, studying mainly studio art. I've worked many different jobs including restaurant server, telecounselor, dry cleaning presser, house painter, janitor, assembly line worker, and day care provider. Ceramic art is my passion and my old pitbull Todo is my constant companion. My main goal now is to start a career in computer programming.
